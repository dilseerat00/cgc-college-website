	<p>
		The field of engineering has a promising future and has enormous amounts of growth in its way. Keeping pace with industrial and technological advancements is of utmost importance. This Engineering colleges  offer courses to move towards the industrial revolution effectively.
	</p>
	<p>
		Engineering education in India is currently facing three major challenges: a shortage of qualified instructors, lack of industry engagement and the low employability of graduates. The first challenge is a result of many qualified engineers retiring and not enough young people choosing engineering as a career. The second problem is that there aren’t enough companies willing to invest in hiring Indian engineers. And lastly, Indians who do take up engineering often don’t find good jobs because they didn’t study the right subjects. Several top level executives have conveyed that the solution lies in graduates being trained in fields like artificial intelligence, robotics and data analytics. These are the skills that are in high demand.
